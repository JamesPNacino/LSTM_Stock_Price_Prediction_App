				<p class="lead">My model which is described in this link, is able to predict future short-term stock price movements significantly more accurate than guessing. Please note, that using historical data to predict stock price movements does not guarantee future results. Each time you submit the form below, a new model will be trained from scratch, which will take a few minutes (5-10 minutes).  Once the model is trained, it can be used to make predictions on the latest stock market data.
				<br><br>
				It is recommended to make predictions using a candlestick pattern (such as hammer or inverted hammer) only when it appears in the most recent closing candle. To check if the stock ticker you are requesting currently exhibits one of these patterns, navigate to the 'Search Candlestick Patterns' tab. If no relevant pattern is present, you can use the 'Random' candlestick pattern, as the models and predictions using this are not dependent on specific patterns.

In this application, 30-day sequences are always used to train the LSTMs, with the final day of the sequence marking the end of the candlestick pattern. If 'Random' is selected, the model will still use 30-day sequences, but the conclusion of the sequence will not depend on any candlestick pattern, as the days are randomly chosen. Selecting 'Random' will provide more training data, as the number of candlestick patterns is limited, given that they occur infrequently in the real world, and random selection allows for a greater variety of sequences to be included in the training set.">Input candlestick pattern</label>
